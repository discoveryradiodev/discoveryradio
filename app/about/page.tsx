          <h2>My Mission</h2>

          <p>The industry as we know it has collapsed inward. What once inspired artists to carve their own path has been reduced to algorithms that keep listeners in a box and force both artists and industry to follow.</p>

          <p>Discovery Radio was born from this drought and intends to end it. For good.</p>

          <p>I built this platform from code I didn't understand — and from artists who thought it was a scam. I built it with people who felt the same drought I did. People who believed connection should be earned. Through presence. Through performance. Through community.</p>

          <p>This isn't a brand. It isn't a playlist. It isn't content.</p>

          <p style={{ fontWeight: 600 }}>It's refusal.</p>

          <p>Refusal to be ranked, optimized, diluted, or decided for.<br />Refusal to let machines tell us what matters.</p>

          <p>Discovery Radio exists for the artists who show up, the listeners who stay curious, and the communities that still believe culture is built by people — not systems.</p>

          <p>If you're looking for comfort, look elsewhere.<br />If you're looking for truth, you're already home.</p>
